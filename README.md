# Smith-Waterman Algorithm Implementation
This project provides a C implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm, which is a popular algorithm used for sequence alignment. The implementation offers a serial version of the algorithm, as well as parallel implementations that use OpenMP threads to speed up the execution. The parallelization is performed at both a coarse level and a fine level to optimize performance on different hardware.

# Features
* Provides a fast and accurate implementation of the Smith-Waterman algorithm for sequence alignment
* Includes serial and parallel implementations using OpenMP threads to optimize performance
* Provides both coarse and fine-level parallelization to optimize performance on different hardware
* Includes a comprehensive set of test cases and a sample dataset to help evaluate the accuracy and performance of the algorithm
